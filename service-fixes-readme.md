# Service Fixes - CORS and Port Issues

## Issues Fixed

1. **CORS Policy Errors**: 
   - Error: `Access to fetch at 'file:///L:/stop-service' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy`
   - Error: `Access to fetch at 'file:///L:/start-service' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy`
   - Error: `Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:3000/stop-service' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check`
   - Fix: 
     - Updated service-manager.js to use absolute URLs with localhost:3000 instead of relative paths
     - Added proper CORS configuration using the 'cors' package in service-starter.js
     - Added explicit handling for OPTIONS preflight requests

2. **Unsafe Port Error**:  
   - Error: `GET http://localhost:6000/learning-progress net::ERR_UNSAFE_PORT`
   - Fix: Changed RL Tuning service port from 6000 (which is considered unsafe by browsers) to port 6001

3. **ML Prediction Error**:
   - Error: `Uncaught TypeError: autoTrader.selectStrategy is not a function`
   - Fix: Added checks to verify if autoTrader exists before calling methods

4. **TradingView Chart Detection**:
   - The console.log "TradingView chart iframe detected" is actually not an error but a status message
   - No fix required for this specific message

## Files Changed

1. **service-manager.js**: 
   - Updated `stopService()` to use http://localhost:3000/stop-service
   - Updated `startService()` to use http://localhost:3000/start-service
   - Changed port for RL Tuning service from 6000 to 6001 in the services configuration

2. **service-starter.js**: 
   - Added the 'cors' package for proper CORS support
   - Configured express to handle OPTIONS preflight requests
   - Changed rlTuning port from 6000 to 6001

3. **rl_tuning.js**: 
   - Updated `fetchLearningProgress()` to use port 6001

4. **rl_tuning.py**: 
   - Changed port from 6000 to 6001
   - Added CORS headers

5. **start_rl_service.bat**: 
   - Updated port number in display message

6. **autoTrader.js**:
   - Updated reference to RL tuning service from port 6000 to 6001

7. **start_all_services.bat**:
   - Updated display message to show correct RL tuning service port

8. **ml_prediction.js**:
   - Added checks for autoTrader existence before calling selectStrategy method

## Next Steps

1. Make sure the 'cors' package is installed:
   ```
   npm install cors --save
   ```

2. Restart your service starter:
   ```
   node service-starter.js
   ```

3. Start all services using the batch file or VS Code tasks

4. Use the test-service-connection.html tool to verify connections

5. Verify that the services can be properly stopped through the UI

Note: If you're opening the HTML file directly from disk (file:// protocol), some CORS issues may still occur. For best results, serve the application through the local web server by running `node service-starter.js` and accessing your application via http://localhost:3000/
