# RL Tuning Service Fix

## Issue

The RL Tuning service was failing to start properly with two main issues:

1. **Incorrect Flask Application Initialization**:
   - Routes were defined before the Flask app was created
   - This caused the routes to not get registered correctly
   - Result: 404 errors for all endpoints

2. **Missing Endpoint**:
   - The frontend was trying to access a `/tune` endpoint
   - This endpoint was not defined in the original service
   - Result: "OPTIONS /tune HTTP/1.1" 404 errors

## Fix

1. **Reorganized Initialization Order**:
   - Moved the Flask app initialization to the top of the file
   - Created the tuner instance before defining routes
   - Added proper CORS handling

2. **Added Missing Endpoint**:
   - Created a new `/tune` endpoint that handles OPTIONS, GET, and POST methods
   - Made the endpoint compatible with the frontend expectations
   - Ensured it returns the same data format as `/get-params`

3. **Added Error Handling**:
   - Added explicit OPTIONS method handling for CORS preflight requests
   - Added better default values when no market data is provided

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. **Start the RL Tuning service**:
   ```
   python rl_tuning.py
   ```

2. **Check connectivity** using test-service-connection.html
   - The "Test RL Tuning (Port 6001)" button should return a success
   - You should see a JSON response with the service status

3. **Test in the main application**:
   - Access http://localhost:3000/
   - The RL Tuning service should show as "Running"
   - The RL Tuning features should work correctly

## Notes

- A backup of the original file has been saved as `rl_tuning.py.bak`
- If you need to revert the changes, you can restore from the backup
